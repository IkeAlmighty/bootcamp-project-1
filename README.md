Sweet Treats

As a customer I want to be able to browse baked goods and teas so that I can buy them

### Rough breakdown of tasks

-   storefront.html
-   styling using tailwind
-   connecting tailwind
-   javascript for changing the page dynamically
-   IF dynamic page change takes too long we can just make another html page
-   javascript for storing user selected teas and bakery items in localstorage
-   modals for enlarging images
-   if we have time: show pairings
